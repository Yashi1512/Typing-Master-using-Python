# Typing-Master-using-Python-with their-various libraries
1.First of all, we should known about python programming language as well as their libreries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tkinter, timeit,etc.
2.Mainly for this project we need/used such libraries are tkinter and as well as timeit also.
-Tkinter is used for faster GUI as well to calculate the time for speed testing, Timeit is calculation/defined that how much time is consumed in execution,
-As well as random() is also used for  returns a random integer value between the two lower and higher limits (including both limits) provided as two parameters. 
 It should be noted that this method is only capable of generating integer-type random values.
3.Then , we need a platform to execute of our program so we download/clone a platform that is visual-studio-code which is common platform for more then one languages. 
4.After then, we write a code in python programming language as well as execute and display their output in visual-studio-code.
