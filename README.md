# Typing-Master-using-Python-with their-various libraries
What are the steps to make this program..??

1.First of all, we should known about python programming language as well as their libreries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, tkinter, timeit,etc.
2.Mainly for this project we need/used such libraries are tkinter and as well as timeit also.
-Tkinter is used for faster GUI as well to calculate the time for speed testing, Timeit is calculation/defined that how much time is consumed in execution,
-As well as random() is also used for  returns a random integer value between the two lower and higher limits (including both limits) provided as two parameters. 
 It should be noted that this method is only capable of generating integer-type random values.
3.Then , we need a platform to execute of our program so we download/clone a platform that is visual-studio-code which is common platform for more then one languages. 
4.After then, we write a code in python programming language as well as execute and display their output in visual-studio-code.

SNAPSHOTS:
Program is ready to calculate the time that is measure of typing speed.

Now, we ready to type the given sentence.

If we write the wrong statement so the output visible is wrong.

If we write the correct statement so in output visible the calculation time.

Finally we done our program.

Just follow me and star my repository.
